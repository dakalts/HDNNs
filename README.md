# Hamilton-Dirac Neural Networks (HDNNs)

## Desicription
HDNNs (Hamilton-Dirac Neural Networks) is a deep learning method for the unsupervised learning of constrained Hamiltonian systems. 
It employs Physics Informed Neural networks to solve the Hamilton-Dirac equations, enabling the learning of constrained symplectic dynamics without labeled data. 

## Dependencies

HDNN requires the following libraries:

Python 3.8+

PyTorch

NumPy

SciPy

Matplotlib (for visualization)
